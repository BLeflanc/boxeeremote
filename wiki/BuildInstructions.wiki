#summary Instructions for setting the project up in eclipse.

= Introduction =

This page explains how to build the project in eclipse. If you haven't used eclipse or programmed for android before, please see the [http://developer.android.com/ Android Eclipse tutorials]

= Checking Out the Code =

  * Install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse], the subversion plugin for eclipse.
  * In Eclipse, go to Window -> Open Repository -> Other... and select "SVN Repository Browsing"
  * In SVN Repositories, right-click, New -> Repository Location, and add "http://boxeeremote.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"
  * Expand the new repository, and right-click on "Boxee Remote" and select Checkout. The defaults should be fine, so press OK.

= Running =

Run it as you would a normal android project. One trick is that you need to disable the "Require Wifi Connection" preference, since the emulator pretends that it's on a mobile network, not wifi.
